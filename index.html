        the inner workings of a surprisingly frustrating interface

          While the average user will have no trouble getting to their
          destination, there exist some extreme edge cases when using this
          elevator. The CIT elevator has a pretty simple interface, no different
          than your average elevator. However, the one major quirk is the
          addition of swiping. During the day, up until around 6pm, all floors
          are accessible without swiping. After 6 or so, floors 3-5 require a
          swipe which only professors, grad students, and ta's have. Despite
          coming daily to this god forsaken building, I have no idea at exactly
          what time the access shuts off, but for the sake of this project, we
          can just say 6pm.
          <br /><br />
          Primary issue: only certain people have access, but the accessibility
          rules are unclear

              Has done this process many times as they are a grad student who

              Was told to go to the 4th floor for a meeting. Had no idea that
              they needed swipe access. Didn't understand why it's even gated
              behind swipe access, and was generally confused by the experience.
